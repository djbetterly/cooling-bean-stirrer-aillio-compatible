### Open Hardware Release • Designed by Dustin Betterly

The **Aillio Bean Stirrer** is an open-hardware accessory designed for the **Aillio R1 and R2 cooling bowls**.  
Its purpose is simple: **speed up the cooling cycle and help remove any chaff that didn’t escape during roasting.**

By actively agitating the beans during cooling, the stirrer:
- Accelerates heat dissipation  
- Improves airflow through the bean mass  
- Breaks up clumps for more uniform cooling  
- Helps eject additional trapped chaff  
- Reduces total cooling time compared to passive airflow alone  

**This tool is for post-roast cooling only.  
It is NOT designed for use inside the roasting drum.**
